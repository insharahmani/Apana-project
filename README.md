 Statistical Data Analysis & Dashboard 
 Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, SQL, and Excel to
 calculate central tendency, dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis. Created an
 interactive dashboard using Streamlit/Power BI to visualize data distributions
 and statistical summaries. Enabled column-wise analysis and real-time
 interaction with dataset insights. Improved understanding of dataset structure
 through cross-platform analytical comparison.
